# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the PF3-CSP repository - a hackathon project that appears to be in its initial setup phase.

**Repository:** https://github.com/TheDAOS/PF3-CSP.git

## Current State

This repository is currently minimal with only a README.md file. As development progresses, this WARP.md file should be updated to include:

## Development Setup (To be updated)

Currently no build system, package manager, or development tools have been configured. Common patterns for hackathon projects might include:

- Python projects: `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `python -m pytest`
- Node.js projects: `npm install`, `npm test`, `npm run build`
- Python data science: `jupyter notebook`, `python main.py`
- Web projects: `npm start`, `npm run dev`

## Architecture (To be updated)

No architecture has been established yet. When code is added, document:

- Main application entry points
- Key modules and their responsibilities
- Data flow and processing patterns
- External dependencies and integrations

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Remote: `origin` (https://github.com/TheDAOS/PF3-CSP.git)
- Standard git workflow for commits and pushes

## Next Steps for Development

When starting development:

1. Add appropriate gitignore file for chosen technology stack
2. Initialize package manager and dependencies
3. Set up project structure and main files
4. Update this WARP.md with actual commands and architecture
5. Add testing framework and CI/CD if needed

## Notes for WARP

- This is a hackathon project, so expect rapid development and iteration
- The technology stack is not yet determined - check for new files to understand the chosen approach
- Update this documentation as the project evolves to reflect actual commands and architecture patterns
